\texttt{
By means of our meritorious deeds,\\
\\
May the Suffering be free from Suffering\\
May the Fear-Struck be free from Fear\\
May the Grieving be free from Grief\\
So too may all Being-Be.\\
From the highest realms of existence to the lowest,\\
May all being arisen in these realms,\\
With form and without form,\\
With perception and without perception,\\
Be released from all Suffering,\\
And attain to Perfect Peace\\
May all being be free from suffering\\
\\
Sadu! Sadu! Sadu!
