# Project Title

**Principia Mathematica II: Electric Boogaloo**

## Description

This project is a comprehensive exploration of mathematics, artificial intelligence, computer vision, and machine learning. Its goal is to guide readers and users from minimal prior knowledge to a foundational understanding of key concepts such as calculus, linear algebra, probability, statistics, and computer science, alongside practical applications in programming and generative art.

## Features

- **Executable Build Scripts**: All scripts in the project are executable for seamless operation. Use the provided command to ensure executability:
  ```bash
  find . -type f -name "*.sh" -exec chmod +x {} \;
  ```
- **Automation**: Streamlined setup and execution processes with dedicated scripts for building, bibliography management, and running the project environment.
- **Comprehensive References**: Includes a `references.bib` file for managing citations and bibliographies, ensuring proper academic rigor.
- **Interactive Components**: Python modules such as `newton.py` provide interactive computational tools.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software and dependencies installed:

- Python 3.8+ for running the computational scripts.
- LaTeX distribution for processing `.tex` files.
- Bash shell to execute the `.sh` scripts.
- Git for version control.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```
2. Make all scripts executable:
   ```bash
   find . -type f -name "*.sh" -exec chmod +x {} \;
   ```
3. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   ./setup_and_run.sh
   ```

## Usage

- **Building**: Execute `build.sh` to compile and build the necessary files.
  ```bash
  ./build.sh
  ```
- **Bibliography Management**: Use `software_bibliography.sh` to process the bibliography:
  ```bash
  ./software_bibliography.sh
  ```
- **Interactive Python Tools**: Run `newton.py` for demonstrations and computational tasks:
  ```bash
  python3 newton.py
  ```

## File Structure

- **build.sh**: Main build script for compiling files.
- **outline.tex**: LaTeX file containing the outline of the documentation or book.
- **software_bibliography.sh**: Script for managing bibliographic entries.
- **setup_and_run.sh**: One-stop script for setting up the environment.
- **newton.py**: Python script for computational demonstrations.
- **README.md**: This documentation file.
- **references.bib**: Bibliography file for academic references.
