\section{Getting Started with README.md}
This section will guide you through the purpose and content of the \texttt{README.md} file. The \texttt{README.md} file serves as an introduction to your project, providing essential information about the structure, purpose, and usage of your repository. Refer to the uploaded \texttt{README.md} file for detailed content.

\section{Using the Shell: Command Line Basics}
Command-line interfaces (CLI) are vital tools for managing and interacting with your system and projects. This section introduces basic shell commands and scripts. Begin with executing the build script provided:
\begin{verbatim}
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
\end{verbatim}
This ensures that the necessary scripts for building and setting up your environment are executable.
